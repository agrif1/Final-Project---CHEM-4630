# Final_Project_Grifasi

This is Alex Grifasi's final project for the CHEM 4630 course at CU Denver.
It is designed to take .xyz file exports from MacMolPlt and convert the pertinent data into a makefp.inp file ready for transfer to the GAMESS software package.

## Installation

1) Download and extract zip to folder of choice.

## Usage

1) Place any number of .xyz files in the 'input' folder.

2)	>>> python Final_Project_Grifasi.py

	# foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
	# foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
	# foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'

	>>> output

3) Check 'output' folder for .inp files for GAMESS integration.
